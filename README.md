For this assignment, I used XPert Learning Services and Chat GPT.

An overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.

The aim of this analysis is to develop and assess the accuracy of a data model designed to predict the creditworthiness of prospective borrowers using peer-to-peer lending services.

Using a bulleted list, describe the accuracy score, the precision score, and recall score of the machine learning model.

Balanced Accuracy Score: 95.20%**
   - The balanced accuracy score of 95.2% indicates that considering both sensitivity (recall/true positive rate) and specificity (true negative rate), the model achieved accurate predictions.

2. **Precision Score: 92%**
   - The precision score of 92% signifies that 92% of the model's positive predictions were correct.

3. **Recall Score: 95%**
   - The recall score of 95% indicates that the model accurately identified 95% of true positive values out of all positive predictions made.
  
 A summary: Summarize the results from the machine learning model. Include your justification for recommending the model for use by the company. If you donâ€™t recommend the model, justify your reasoning.

I suggest employing this model for predicting borrowers' creditworthiness, given its accuracy of over 95% in forecasting initial loan repayment outcomes. This level of accuracy can effectively inform a business risk profile, ensuring adequate capital flow to sustain profitability for lenders.
